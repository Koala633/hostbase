Android is dumbshit...some android browser app work with this code : (directly taking a picture).
<input id="uploadImage" type="file" capture="user" accept="image/*" name="image" />

And other need this code because they don't recognize the capture html attribute... :
<input id="uploadImage" type="file" accept="image/*" name="image" />

To make a local test you need to chmod 777 * into the folder where the ajax and js code are.
NOTE : you can't use this code directly into your main folder of apache or httpd.
